You can do the same with th_keywords_processnames_elk.txt and the other files **as long as the field type is text**
Upload it and follow the same steps, at number 12 change the list_id to th_keywords_processnames_elk.txt
Then change the indicator mapping field to process.name instead (field type must be text).
